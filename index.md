# Tom Vincent

Hi, I'm Tom.

I'm a full-stack developer based in London.

I'm currently looking for speaking gigs. I've previously [talked about my experiences][ehealth] building innovative tech to improve access to healthcare in Sub-Saharan Africa and have done a range of technical talks at local meetups. Please [get in touch][] if that sounds interesting!
