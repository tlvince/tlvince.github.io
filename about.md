**Hi**! I'm Tom.

Since 2013, I have operated as a contract senior full stack developer,
completing assignments around the world from the Hong Kong-based Fable
Foundation, West African-based public healthcare initiatives eHealth Africa and
Field Intelligence, and most recently returning to home to London with fintech
leaders ClearScore.

I'm currently specialising in serverless architectures with Node.js to deliver
highly scalable, event-driven applications. I've previous experience in
investment banking, music, audio production and photography.

Whilst this is primarily a technical blog, I also write on travelling, the
ever-inspiring open source community and lessons on self-improvement.

**Thanks** for stopping by!
